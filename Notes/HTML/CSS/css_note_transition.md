# CSS note transition

### __Review / Note__

- A ```property``` that will transition.
```css
transition-property: property
```

- The ```duration``` which describes how long the transition takes.
```css
transition-duration: 'number'{s, ms}
```

- The ```delay``` to pause before the transition will take place.
```css
transition-delay: 'number'{s, ms}
```

- The ```timing function``` that describes the transitionâ€™s acceleration.
```css
transition-timing-function: ease-in / ease-out / ease-in-out / linear
```

__Note__: ```transition``` is a shorthand.
```css
transition: transition-property transition-duration transition-timing-function transition-delay
```
